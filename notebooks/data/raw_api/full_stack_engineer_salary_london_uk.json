We are proud to offer a workplace where the sharpest developers come together to strategically plan and swiftly execute practices which see us maintain our existing market dominance and attain global expansion. We owe our success to our customers who have seen us grow across a decade, and our talented team who have made that growth possible!\n\nWhat are we looking for?\n\nYou’re a full-stack dev - you’ve been around the block, and you know your way through both backend trenches and frontend battlefields. PHP? Still your reliable sidekick. JavaScript? Sometimes a mischievous friend, sometimes a chaos gremlin, but you’ve learned how to keep it in line.\n\nYou work best with fierce independence. You don’t need hand-holding - you’re the one who does the hand-holding when it’s needed. You don’t wait for direction; you are the direction. To twist a phrase: you’re not the one who knocks, you’re the one who delivers.\n\nYou live for making things work. Whether that’s a clean new feature, a quirky legacy bug fix, or tracking down why that button refuses to do what it’s told. You like code that’s neat and maintainable, but you’re also practical - you know sometimes duct tape is exactly what the situation calls for.\n\nBuilding apps is your thing - you tinker, refactor, and optimize because you can’t help yourself. You get a kick out of speeding things up, cleaning things up, and occasionally wondering what exactly your predecessor was drinking when they wrote that function.\n\nAnd yes, you’re not afraid to dive into the relics. That PHP app last touched in 2010? It still needs love. The JavaScript file with 1,200 lines and no semicolons? You’ll wrestle it into submission.\n\nWhat will you be doing?\n• Manage your own time while adhering to priorities set by the company.\n• Build new features and improve existing ones across our platforms.\n• Refactor and enhance applications to keep them performant, scalable, and maintainable.\n• Write tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to ensure software reliability.\n• Be involved in every phase of the software lifecycle, from ideation to deployment.\n• Participate in deep technical discussions and help shape our applications and infrastructure.\n• Get hands-on with all elements of the stack, from backend logic to frontend interactions.\n• Identify inefficiencies and help streamline workflows, reducing unnecessary work.\n• Take ownership of your work, ensuring high-quality results and maintainable solutions.\n\nRequirements\n\nWhat will you bring along?\n• 10+ years of PHP development, with expertise in at least one framework (Symfony, Zend preferred).\n• 12+ years of web application development experience: you’ve seen the evolution of web tech and know how to build for the future.\n• 6+ years working with frontend frameworks/libraries like Vue.js, React, Nuxt, or Next.js.\n• Deep understanding of scalable web architectures: monolithic, microservices, or hybrid, you know when to use what.\n• Strong communication skills, with the ability to explain technical concepts to both engineers and non-engineers.\n• Passion for automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end) and test-driven development (TDD).\n• Hands-on experience building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.\n• Strong expertise in PHP development, debugging, and algorithm/software design.\n• Knowledge of agile development tools, techniques, and principles.\n• Familiarity with Ansible and Terraform for infrastructure automation.\n• Experience deploying, managing, and scaling applications in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Strong grasp of web security: encryption, authentication, authorization, and everything in between.\n\nWe are always looking for the best candidates, so if you think you would be a good fit even if you don't meet 100% of the requirements, we would love to hear from you!\n\nBenefits\n\nHow We Support Our Contractors\n• €60/hour + retention bonus scheme: Competitive contractor rate with a generous bonus paid every 6 months based on your time with us.\n• Top-Notch Workstation: We provide the latest MacBook, branded merchandise, and everything you need for an optimal work environment.\n• Global Co-Working Access: Work from a global network of co-working spaces to keep your work-life dynamic and flexible.\n• Flexibility: Enjoy full flexibility in work location and hours, supporting a work-life balance tailored to your needs.\n• Events and Gatherings: Participate in exciting events throughout the year, including team gatherings, cultural events, and other fun activities.",

      "job_description": "At Improbable, we want to help businesses navigate the increasingly more complex and intertwined world. Enterprise metaverses break down the organisational and technical siloes that have meant digital twins have not been fully exploitable by the broader business. They empower entire companies to continually optimise and prepare for the future by providing a digital representation that can be visualised, analysed, explored and experimented upon. We use enterprise metaverses to empower businesses to explore future scenarios and respond to change and disruption more effectively using digital twins and enterprise metaverses.\n\nEnterprise Insights is a newly formed business unit of 40+ people within Improbable, and with it, there are lots of interesting engineering problems to solve. We are looking for a senior engineer to work with our solution team in developing a modern user interface to allow our customers to interact with our advanced simulation capabilities. You will be surrounded by people who want to improve everything and everyone around them, and who compel you to improve yourself. We’re motivated by the fulfilment of solving hard problems to achieve something profound and transformative.\nYour Opportunity:\n• You will be a key player in shaping the future of both your and the wider Engineering teams. We are a new unit in start-up mode and have a lot of exciting challenges accordingly.\n• Lead and shape the future of our solution team consisting of full-stack engineers, working closely with our Product, Modelling and DevOps teams.\n• Drive our technical direction in the solution space - we have a strong technical foundation, but we are always looking to innovate further and push boundaries.\n• Mentor and grow the team - with a strong focus on coaching and developing our talented junior engineers.\n• Handle interdependencies with our other teams (including the Modelling and Simulations team)\n• Effectively balance the creative exploration of a consumer-facing experience with the need to maintain our delivery commitments.Why you're made for this:\n• You thrive on the inherent ambiguity of an early-stage business. You can navigate around frequent changes and see the opportunity to learn and adapt our technology as we go along.\n• You’re passionate about technology and how it can help deliver a great product. We use React, Node and Typescript as our core technologies and expect all our engineers to be proficient in those but if you believe there are other tools for the job, you’ll be happy to suggest and convince your team and stakeholders to adopt those.\n• You feel comfortable anywhere in the stack; you’ll be given the tools and trust to work on the end-to-end solution alongside our Designers, Modellers and DevOps engineers.\n• You’re experienced with coaching and mentoring a team - you don’t want to stop being hands-on on but you also enjoy other activities (whether it’s pairing and teaching a more junior member or sitting with your product team to figure out where we’re heading in the next 3 months).\n• You prioritise quick delivery: foundations are important and we’re all in when it comes to doing this right, especially when it has a lasting impact. However, the biggest risk to us is building the wrong stuff rather than building the stuff wrong. We prefer to ship quickly and learn quickly.\n• You love working as part of a close-knit group. We’re a highly collaborative team and often work together to solve complex problems and learn new skills. You proactively reach out to the wider team when there’s a need for input and encourage others to do so as well.Improbable is determined to foster an environment where people can do their best work and feel like they belong. We believe a healthy culture, strong values and contribution from a diverse range of individuals will help us to achieve success.\n\nWe do not discriminate based on race, ethnicity, gender, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age disability, veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any other legally protected status.",
