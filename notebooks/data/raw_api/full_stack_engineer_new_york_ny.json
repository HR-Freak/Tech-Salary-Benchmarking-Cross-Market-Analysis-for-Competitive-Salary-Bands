Our clients are comprised of the brightest minds in the financial and investing worlds, entrepreneurs, business owners, leaders, and influential families who entrust us with the holistic care of their fiscal well-being. The firm was founded in early 2000 and for over 20 years has nurtured our culture with talented people from diverse backgrounds who care about each other, our clients, and our collective communities. In our quest for continuous improvement, we strive to develop not only world class talent, but world class humans!\n\nPOSITION OVERVIEW\n\nBBR Partners is seeking a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer to play a key role in developing our modern application ecosystem with an API-first, product engineered architecture. Your work will directly support the growing needs of our advisory, operations, and research organizations. In this role, you will collaborate with business stakeholders, data teams, and other developers to design, build, and implement robust software solutions that meet both technical and operational requirements.\n\nYou'll be designing and delivering modern, scalable systems in production, under live client constraints, while strategically decoupling legacy applications that power critical asset management capabilities (e.g. Client Reporting, Portfolio Management, Trading, and Operations). You'll work alongside a team of skilled Software Engineers to build API products, own end-to-end product modules, establish engineering standards, and expand engineering rigor across the team through this transformation. This role requires technical depth, pragmatic decision-making, and the ability to operate effectively with both engineers and business stakeholders in a high-trust, fast-moving environment.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n• Design and Build: Full-stack applications and APIs to support portfolio management, trading, and operational workflows in conjunction with technical and business teams.\n• Modernize Under Constraints: Incrementally replace legacy functionality with maintainable, API-backed services—without breaking production or disrupting critical client workflows; implement feature flags, rollback strategies, and validation mechanisms to ensure zero regressions.\n• Architect Modern Solutions: Design and expand modern web applications while incorporating best practices, focusing on maintainability, scalability, performance, and correctness for complex investment domains (securities, accounts, mandates, performance, composites).\n• Integrate with 3rd Party Systems: Develop APIs and integrations with third-party asset management platforms and data providers, including market data providers (FactSet, Bloomberg, Refinitiv), execution platforms, reporting tools (Seismic, d1g1t), and portfolio accounting systems (APX).\n• Maintain Infrastructure: Deploy, configure, and manage Python (Django/FastAPI) and React applications across a hybrid environment (Linux/Windows, Docker, VMs) to ensure reliable deployment and uptime; instrument services with observability tooling (Datadog) and participate in on-call rotations.\n• Propagate Best Practices: Introduce and enforce unified standards, unit testing, CI/CD pipelines, version control workflows, secrets management, and other development best practices to improve the team's workflow and code quality.\n• Collaborate with Data Teams: Partner with data engineers on versioned data contracts (dbt + Snowflake) and service integration patterns to support decoupling applications from direct database dependencies.\n• Mentor and Upskill: Provide mentorship to team members through code reviews, pairing sessions, and design feedback, promoting a culture of learning and technical growth while raising engineering standards.\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n• Technical Expertise\n• 6+ years of professional software engineering experience with significant full-stack ownership and production accountability.\n• Proven success modernizing legacy systems under production constraints - demonstrated experience sunsetting and replacing outdated software solutions with maintainable, scalable systems.\n• Python web frameworks: Deep, hands-on experience building scalable services using Django, Flask, or FastAPI in production environments.\n• React and TypeScript: Production experience delivering data-heavy, high-trust user interfaces for complex workflows.\n• Relational databases: Strong expertise modeling and querying relational data (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL) with attention to schema design, performance, referential integrity, and auditability.\n• Cloud and infrastructure: Hands-on experience with containers (Docker), CI/CD pipelines, secrets management, and runtime observability using Datadog, New Relic, or similar platforms.\n• Testing mindset: Demonstrated use of unit, integration, and E2E testing frameworks (pytest, vitest, Playwright, or equivalents).\n• Domain Knowledge\n• Financial services experience: Background developing or supporting systems for portfolio management, trading, risk management, or wealth management operations.\n• Investment data fluency: Familiarity with financial data providers (Bloomberg, FactSet, Refinitiv), common identifiers (FIGI, SEDOL, CUSIP), and third-party platforms (OMS/EMS, portfolio accounting systems like Advent APX or Geneva).\n• Knowledge of financial instruments, market data, and investment workflows (performance attribution, composite construction, rebalancing, reconciliation).\n• Professional Attributes\n• Clear communication and product sense: Ability to collaborate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders; translate business needs into technical solutions without over-engineering.\n• Bias for pragmatism: Track record of making well-reasoned tradeoffs, favoring readable code, small iterations, and sustainable progress over perfection.\n• Strong collaborator: Performs thoughtful code reviews, writes clear design feedback, pairs with teammates, and helps raise engineering standards through mentoring, knowledge sharing, and consistent follow-through on team practices.\n• Comfort with ambiguity: Able to work independently, prioritize effectively, and operate in a dynamic environment where requirements evolve and legacy constraints are real.\n• Development Practices\n• Experience advancing SDLC maturity - version control (Git), branching strategies, pull request workflows, and automated testing/deployment.\n• Familiarity with API design (REST, OpenAPI/Swagger), versioning strategies, and backward compatibility.\n• Understanding of security and compliance requirements in financial applications (least-privilege access, audit logging, secrets rotation).\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n• Opportunity to collaborate with accomplished colleagues in an entrepreneurial and fast-paced environment.\n• Competitive base salary and incentive compensation.\n• Company subsidized health, dental and vision insurance for employee, partner, and dependents.\n• 401K plan, Life insurance, and short & long-term disability coverage.\n• One Medical membership (covered for employee and dependents), Employee assistance program (EAP), Gym reimbursement and other wellness offerings.\n• Pre-tax transit and parking programs, Health Savings Account (HSA) and flexible spending programs for medical and dependent care.\n• Personalized development and career opportunities.\n• Flexible time off, paid parental leave, and opportunity for Sabbatical with company tenure.\n• Hybrid remote work environment, \"Work from Anywhere\" weeks, and casual dress.\n• New office space with a variety of perks and amenities including catered lunches and stocked pantry.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nBase salary for this position will be determined during the interview process and will vary based on multiple reasons, including but not limited to prior experience, relevant expertise, current business needs, and market factors. The expected base salary for the role will generally be between $150,000 and $200,000 per year at the commencement of employment, but the final salary offered may be outside this range based on these reasons and individual circumstances. Additionally, base salary is only part of the total compensation package, which, depending on the position, may also include discretionary bonuses, alternative incentive packages and Company-sponsored benefit programs. This position is at-will, and the Company reserves the right to modify base salary (as well as any other discretionary payment or compensation program) at any time, including for reasons related to individual performance, Company or individual department/team performance, and market factors.\n\nWe value and seek diversity of thought and equity of representation. The environment at BBR is inclusive of all, collaborative and endlessly curious. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.",
