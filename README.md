# Tech-Salary-Benchmarking-Cross-Market-Analysis-for-Competitive-Salary-Bands

## Introduction 
Tech salaries vary widely across our locations because of:
- local talent demand vs offer
- cost of living
- market maturity
- seniority expectations
- competitiveness

For the People Team, creating salary bands that are competitive, fair and market aligned per location supports:
- hiring ease and strategy
- retention
- equity
- forecasting costs
- global mobility decisions

Because markets use different currencies, all compensation figures will be standardised into GBP for consistent comparison.
